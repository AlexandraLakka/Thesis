# Functions used for testing

In order to collect our data, we decided to use 5 functions from the [Pythonic Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/keon/algorithms). 
For each function, we created a Python script and excuted it for different inputs.

To execute:
```bash
python3 {script_name}.py
```
